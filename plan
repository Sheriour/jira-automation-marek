Getting Jira Refresh Token API to work (https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-3lo-apps)
- You login to Jira Developer console
- Create an app
- Setup OAuth 2.0
- If you hit "configure" in Authorization for OAuth 2.0, you get the "Authorization URL generator" link at the bottom,
one with "https://auth.atlassian.com/authorize?audience=api.atlassian.com&client_id......."
- In that link, change state=${YOUR_USER_BOUND_VALUE} to state=whateverstringofcharacters
- IF you are generating a refresh token (yes, you are), add "%20offline_access" to scopes
- Go to that URL in browser and allow access via SSO
- It will redirect you to you callback URL, which is most likely a fake website. But the URL will have you code=<here>
- You shoot that code at the Jira by using grant_type": "authorization_code" and "code" param
- In response, you should get both access_token and refresh_token
- From this point, you can instead auth with grant_type": "refresh_token" and "refresh_token" param
- Each time you use this, you get a new Access Token, and a new refresh token to do this again
- Previous refresh token gets invalidated each time
